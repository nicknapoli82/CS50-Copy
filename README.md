# CS50-Copy
A rust version of CS50s copy program

Really just that. A simple, almost line for line, implimtation of CS50 copy.c program in Rust.
Thats it.

I left the original c code in the file hopefully for ease of reference.
I also pretty much intentionally made the Rust code very verbose. 

This code is not intended to be fast, or optimized. Just a close representation of the c code
